**Shiva Shettar Fall 2022 Data 606: **

## Introduction

Analyzing customer lifetime value is critical to improving marketing decision-making, campaign ROI and customer retention. Weirdly, everyone in marketing understands its importance, but few can define it sufficiently to measure it correctly. The exact same thing applies to customer retention, which is also commonly misunderstood by most marketers. **Customer Lifetime Value is the discounted value of future profits a customer yields to the company.** Customer lifetime value can help you see which customers are worth your focus and investment and allow you to better plan your marketing budget.
